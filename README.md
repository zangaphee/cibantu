CiBantu languages translator

Bantu languages are very similar in structure and vocabulary. So similar that I believe they really ought to be called dialects. The objectives of this project are to provide online translation for CiBantu languages. English will be used as the reference language for the time being. CiNyanja will be the main Bantu language because that's what the author knows.

It is premised that intra-Bantu language translation should be simpler because of their similarities.
